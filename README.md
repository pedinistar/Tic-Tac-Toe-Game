## üé≤ How to Play

1. **Game Start**:
   - The game begins with a welcome message displayed in ASCII art.
   - You will always play as **"X"** and take the first move.

2. **Making a Move**:
   - When prompted, enter a number between `1-9` corresponding to the position on the board.
   - The board positions are mapped as follows:
     ```
      1 | 2 | 3
     -----------
      4 | 5 | 6
     -----------
      7 | 8 | 9
     ```
   - Your chosen position will be marked with **"X"**.

3. **Computer's Move**:
   - The computer will randomly select an empty spot on the board to place **"O"**.

4. **Win or Tie**:
   - The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.
   - A win is determined when three of the same marks are in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
   - If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## üèÜ Game Logic

The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move. The logic is handled through several functions:

- **`check_horizontal()`**: Checks for a win across horizontal rows.
- **`check_vertically()`**: Checks for a win down vertical columns.
- **`check_diagonals()`**: Checks for a win along diagonals.
- **`check_tie()`**: Determines if the game is a tie when all spots are filled.

## ü§ñ Computer Bot

The computer bot randomly selects an available spot on the board to place **"O"**. The bot only plays when it is the computer's turn.
